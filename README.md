# uLisp T-Deck
A version of uLisp to convert the LilyGO T-Deck into a self-contained handheld Lisp computer. The files are as follows:

* ulisp-tdeck.ino - the uLisp source file, to be compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE.
* ulisp-tdeck-comments.ino - identical but including comprehensive comments.
